#### It contains some supplementary materials for the article: 
#### New lower bounds on the minimum singular value of a matrix

It contains the following:
1. **The supplementary file:** SupplementaryFile.pdf, which contains the class of pair of matrices P, Q that correspond to the case r=0 in section 1. And the choice of subspaces M_1 and M_3 for completing the proof of Theorem 3.1 is described in section 2 of this file.
2. **MATLAB code for lower bound minimum singular value of a 2x2 block matrix:** lb_minsblock.m
3. **MATLAB code for Example 3,6,7:** examplematrices.m
4. **MATLAB code for Example 5:** exampleparameter.m
